# DL-Model-NLP-Disaster-Tweets
In this study, different kinds of deep learning models will be used to address this challenge. Specifically, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) networks, and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) model will be used to classifying tweets.
